In this directory you can found scripts (bash and python scripts) to do simple
actions that right now can't be done by Simple World.

run.sh do several iterations over the world adding food and bugs and creating
writing some information about the state of the world. You must create the
world before executing the script and modify the path to simple world and the
bugs.

The rest of the scripts are used to get information about the world and some
are used by run.sh.
