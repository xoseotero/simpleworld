# Get a iterator of the multimap.
# The node returned is part of the hierarchy of nodes, not a copy. The only
# secure calls that can be made over the node returned are std_prev and
# std_next.
# If the multimap is changed after the call to this function the behaviour is
# undefined.
# IN:  g0 pointer to the multimap
# OUT: g0 first node
# OUT: g1 error status
#      STD_NOERROR: no errors
#      STD_EINVAL: the multimap is empty
#      STD_EFAULT: the pointer is not valid
