Simple World
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple World is a simulation of a very simple world. A very simple form of life lives in this world: the bugs. These bugs can do simple actions: move, attack, reproduce, etc. Their objective is to survive, so they must fight each other.

The bugs have a code (their ADN) where the actions that they do are defined. This code must be programmed, but once the bugs reproduce this code can undergo mutations (elimination of parts of the code, addition of random code or disorder of the code). So, after several generations of bugs, the original code (the code programmed) and the code executed by a bug can vary a lot.

Bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs can only do very simple actions:
1.  Do nothing
2.  Suicide
3.  Get info about the bug itself (id, energy, position and orientation)
4.  Detect a object in front of the bug
5.  Move (forward and backward)
6.  Turn (left and right)
7.  Take a object to move it with the bug
8.  Push a object
9.  Fight (attack and defend)
10. Talk (send and receive messages)

Information about the environment 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The environment of Simple World can change from time to time. The environment is formed by:
1. Time since the world has been created.
2. Percent of mutated code in new code.
3. Energy needed for the actions.
