-- Simple World 1.0b1 --

The CPU is less resistant to errors than in the previous versions. Now,
when the code causes a interrupt if the interrupt is supposed to be
handled but some error happens, the bug is killed. Until now, in the
previous case, the CPU tries to send a new interrupt, but sometimes this
is impossible.

This version has incompatibles changes in the database too. The database 
version is still 1 because this is the first beta version and the 
previous was alpha ones. But, from now, every incompatible change in the 
database will change the database version.


-- Simple World 1.0a4 (2008/04/14) --

This was supposed to be the first beta of Simple World, but there are
more changes than previously thought. Some of these changes were
incompatibles with previous versions and prevent the use of previous
bugs in this version:
a) changes in the instructions and in the registers of the CPU
b) new registers in the CPU
c) changes in the database


-- Simple World 1.0a3 (2008/01/28) --

This is the last alpha version of Simple World. With this version, all 
the functionality of the specification 1.0 is working. This means, that:
a) the bugs can be coded
b) the bugs interact with the World
c) the bugs can put eggs
d) the code of the eggs can mutate


-- Simple World 1.0a2 (2007/12/10) --

This version allows the first battles between the bugs. They can go for 
all the World, get information about what they found in its path, attack 
other bugs and eat food. The only bug present in this version, 
brainless, can do all this.


-- Simple World 1.0a1 (2007/11/12) --

This is the first release of Simple World, the first alpha of 1.0.
The functionality of this release is not completed. The bugs can only 
move and get information about the World.
