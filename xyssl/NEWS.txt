    * Fixed some portability issues on WinCE, MINIX 3, Plan9
      (thanks to Benjamin Newman), HP-UX, FreeBSD and Solaris
    * Improved the performance of the EDH key exchange

      generated) and in ssl_parse_client_hello (max. client
      version was not properly set), thanks to Didier Rebeix
    * Fixed another bug in ssl_parse_client_hello: clients with
      cipherlists larger than 96 bytes were incorrectly rejected
