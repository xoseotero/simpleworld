*** Dependencies:
Simple World has a few dependencies:
 - C++ compiler, for example GNU Compiler Collection (http://gcc.gnu.org/)
 - cmake (http://cmake.org/) to build the source code
 - library boost (http://boost.org/)

*** Installation:
1. Create a subdirectory and change the directory to it.
(or use a shell script to do the job)
1. admin/autogen.sh INSTALL_DIR
2. cmake ..
(if cmake couldn't autodetect the dependencies, execute ccmake and modify
the needed variables, press C -configure-, E -exit- and Q -quit-)
3. ccmake .
4. make && make test && make install

*** Problems:
If you found problems with these instructions or the compilation send a
mail to the mailing list: simpleworld-list@lists.sourceforge.net
